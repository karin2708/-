                   Celia took an active role in her daughter's education, often taking her to the library. Celia 
                   had been a good student in her youth, graduating from high school at age 15, yet she could not further
                   her own education because her family instead chose to send her brother to college. Celia wanted her 
                   daughter to get more education, which she thought would allow Ruth to become a high school history 
                   teacher. Ruth attended James Madison High School, whose law program later dedicated a courtroom 
                   in her honor. Celia struggled with cancer throughout Ruth's high school years and died the day before 
                   Ruth's high school graduation.

                   Bader attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where she was a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi. 
                   While at Cornell, she met Martin D. Ginsburg at age 17.She graduated from Cornell with a bachelor 
                   of arts degree in government on June 23, 1954. She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the highest-ranking 
                   female student in her graduating class. Bader married Ginsburg a month after her graduation from Cornell. 
                   She and Martin moved to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where he was stationed as a Reserve Officers' Training Corps 
                   officer in the Army Reserve after his call-up to active duty. At age 21, she worked for the Social 
                   Security Administration office in Oklahoma, where she was demoted after becoming pregnant with her first child.
                   She gave birth to a daughter in 1955.

                   In the fall of 1956, Ginsburg enrolled at Harvard Law School, where she was one of only nine women in a
                   class of about 500 men. The Dean of Harvard Law reportedly asked the female law students, 
                   including Ginsburg, "How do you justify taking a spot from a qualified man?" When her husband 
                   took a job in New York City, Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School and became the first woman 
                   to be on two major law reviews: the Harvard Law Review and Columbia Law Review. In 1959, she earned 
                   her Juris Doctor degree at Columbia and tied for first in her class.
