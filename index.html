                        Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the second woman ever to sit on the United States Supreme <br>
                        Court and is known as the legal architect of the modern women's movement.<br><br><br> 
                        She, more than any other person, pointed out that many laws encouraged gender <br>
                        discrimination; that is, they led to better treatment of men than women instead 
                        of guaranteeing<br> equal rights and opportunities to all as was intended by the United 
                        States Constitution.<br>

            After working for District Judge Edmund L. Palmieri in New York, Ginsburg joined the faculty 
            of Rutgers University, where, in order to keep her job, she wore overly large clothes to hide 
            the fact that she was carrying her second child. She was only the second female professor at 
            Rutgers and one of only twenty women law professors in the country. In 1972, after teaching a 
            course on women and the law at Harvard University, she was appointed the first female faculty 
            member in the law school's history.

        <h3>Supreme Court justice</h3>
        <hr>
        <pre>With the retirement of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Byron White (1917–) in 1993, President Bill Clinton 
            (1946–) wanted a replacement with the intellect and the political skills to deal with the Supreme Court's 
            top conservatives. He chose Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Court observers praised her commitment to the details of
             the law, her intelligent questioning of lawyers arguing before her, and her talent for using calm and 
             sensible arguments to win over her fellow judges.
